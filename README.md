# Firefox-Dynasty-Downloader-PrefPane
A Preference Pane which can download builds of Firefox Dynasty (Firefox backported legacy OS X) and apply some customizations on top. This is useful if:

* Firefox Dynasty is the only web browser installed on your system, and you want to be able to download new builds and quickly revert to older builds if something goes wrong.
* You like the customizations I've applied to make Firefox better integrated into OS X. This includes respecting settings in System Preferences for options such as text replacement and custom keyboard shortcuts.

Note that the PrefPane will not automatically update Firefox Dynasty, nor will it update itself.

I did not create Firefox Dynasty! All credit for Firefox Dynasty itself goes to i3roly! https://github.com/i3roly/firefox-dynasty
